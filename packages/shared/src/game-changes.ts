// Game changes — the canonical "things that happened to the world" registry.
// Each entry becomes a persona-delta in the targeted NPCs' `state:<npcId>`
// once per room (dedup'd via `seeded:<id>` storage key). Every NPC in scope
// reads it at session start via memoryBlob's "## What's changed about you"
// section and integrates it in-character.
//
// THE WORKFLOW (the whole point of this file):
//   1. Ship a code change.
//   2. Add a GameChange entry below describing what NPCs should know.
//      Write the `summary` from the NPC's POV — second person, present tense.
//   3. Reload the server. onStart calls seedGameChanges() which writes the
//      delta to every targeted NPC and sets seeded:<id> so it never re-fires.
//   4. Next conversation: NPCs naturally reference the change.
//
// WHAT BELONGS HERE:
//   - New mechanics ("there's a coffee maker now")
//   - New characters ("Halsey is back in the arena")
//   - World-state changes that should be common NPC knowledge
//   - Permanent character changes that come with code/persona edits
//
// WHAT DOES NOT BELONG HERE:
//   - Per-player history ("Jeff is your friend now") — that's friendship state.
//   - Event-triggered knowledge ("a player just discovered coffee") — that's
//     an in-fiction cascade, handled imperatively (see coffee:discovered).
//   - One-off character changes you set manually via `pnpm npc:state`. If you
//     want them to persist across map/room boots and apply to fresh rooms,
//     ADD THEM HERE instead so they're reproducible.
//
// DEDUP CONTRACT: `id` is the dedup key. Once an id is seeded into a room,
// changing its `summary` will NOT re-seed — bump the id (e.g. add a -v2
// suffix) if you want every existing room to re-apply.
